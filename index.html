                <p>Welcome new recruit! You have been selected for The Imperial
                    space program to become a part of the Navis Imperialis.
                    The Imperial Navy, or Navis Imperialis in High Gothic,
                    is one of the armed forces employed by the Imperium.
                    While the Astra Militarum (or Imperial Guard) is
                    responsible for the Imperium's ground forces, the Imperial
                    Navy is responsible for the fleets of warships that soar
                    between the stars and planets in the Imperium as well as
                    engaging threats both inside and outside the Imperium's borders.
                    The Imperial Navy is the military arm of the Imperial Fleet and was,
                    until its separation after the Horus Heresy, a branch of the Imperial
                    Army.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fleet Structure
                    The Imperial Navy is organized into five fleets, each assigned to one of the Segmentae Majoris.
                    Each fleet is named for the Segmentum in which it is based, such as the Battlefleet Solar.

                    These fleets are then subdivided into smaller fleets patrolling individual sectors and
                    subsectors, and are also generally named after the area they safeguard. For example, Battlefleet
                    Gothic protects the Gothic Sector.

                    The Imperial Navy's administrative center is the Naval Headquarters on Terra.
